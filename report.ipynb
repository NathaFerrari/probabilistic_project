    "The transition probability matrix A is constructed to model the robot’s motion within the grid-based environment under strict physical constraints. Transitions are allowed only between neighboring cells in the four cardinal directions, while diagonal movements and transitions through obstacles are explicitly excluded. For each valid state, all feasible outgoing transitions toward accessible neighboring states are assigned equal probability, ensuring a uniform redistribution of probability mass among admissible moves. This construction guarantees that the resulting matrix is stochastic and accurately reflects the local and non-deterministic nature of the robot’s motion within the maze.\n",

    "The transition matrix A represents the motion dynamics of the robot within the maze by encoding, for each state, the probability of transitioning to any other state in a single time step. Each row of the matrix corresponds to a starting state, while each column represents a possible destination state. Nonzero entries appear only for physically reachable neighboring cells, indicating that the robot can move exclusively toward accessible adjacent positions. The equality of the transition probabilities reflects the assumption of a uniform random choice among all feasible movements.\n",
